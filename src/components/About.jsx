        My journey as a developer began with a deep fascination for the power of Web Application and mobile apps. Driven by a desire to create engaging and innovative experiences, & a passion for creating customer-focused solutions, I've explored everything from game design to full-stack development. My experience includes React, React Native, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Git ... etc. Through personal projects and exploration I thrive on identifying problems and envisioning creative web/mobile app solutions. With my quick learning capability and fast paced startup work experience, I can adapt to new technologies and collaborate to bring ambitious ideas to life.        </p>
